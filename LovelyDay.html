	<h2>Have A Lovely Day!</h2>
	<p> Make sure that you are not overworking yourself!  Include a time in the day where you can relax and your body can heal.  Taking a few minutes off the clock to take deep breathes can help your mind think.  Do something you think is calming and eat a good meal!  Some things other people may do are yoga, drawing, sleeping, going out somewhere like a small cafe with a friend, seeing nature, and more!  Keeping a journal is also a great way to keep up with everyday things! </p>
	<p>Remember, taking care of you and your mental health is just as important as doing your work!  You need to make sure that you make time for it.  Just keep this in mind as your days go on and never forget....Have a lovely day!</p>
